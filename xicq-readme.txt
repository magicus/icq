WHAT IS XICQ?
"""""""""""""
  Xicq is
   - not supported by Mirabilis Ltd. in any way.
   - an ICQ client for Linux (being ported to Amige at the moment, and for
     other systems incl. OS/2 in the future) coded in C++ so it don't use
     any resource hungry toolkit.
   - not done. Development has just started so alot of features is yet to
     be implemented.
   - of course freeware.

05/06/1998       - You can now change your online status.
-tnc             - Added some more statuses.

05/04/1998       - Development is slow at the time, since I'm working on a
-tnc               project for my exam... Yikes.
                 - I think Mirabilis Ltd. is going to scrap the version 2
                   protocol. Since Xicq will not be useable if this happens
                   hacking version 4 have 1st priority. The sooner we get
                   this ripped apart the better.
